# Trace 3: Traceroute
## Briefly describe how the traceroute tool works including which network protocols are in use.

The traceroute tool by default sends UDP packets to the destination address. Users can specify what protocol (ICMP, UDP, TCP) to use.

The traceroute sends out packets with increasing TTL values to the destination. When a router receives a packet, it decrements the TTL value. If the TTL value becomes 0, then the router will drop the packet and send an ICMP Time Exceeded message back to the source. When the destination receives the packet, it will send back an ICMP Destination Unreachable or ICMP Echo Reply.

The packet with a TTL value of 1 will be dropped at the first router, the packet with a TTL value of 2 will be dropped at the second router, and so on and so forth. The traceroute uses ICMP packets sent back from the routers to gradually builds a list of intermediate routers.
